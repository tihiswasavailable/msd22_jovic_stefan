# Lottary combination
Is a Java program, which calculates lottary combinates. The program generates a random seed based on the current time in milliseconds, adds the digits of the seed together to get a sum, and then generates lottery combinations based on that sum.

## Instalation 
To run the program, you will need a Java development environment installed on your computer. You can use any IDE that supports Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

To run the program, follow these steps:

- Open the project in your IDE.
- Locate the Main.java file in the src directory.
- Run the Main.java file.

## Usage
The program will generate automatically lottery combinations based on the sum of the digits of the current time in milliseconds. The program generates five distinct random integers between 1 and 50 and two distinct random integers between 1 and 12 for each combination. The output will be displayed in the console.

## Contrabuting
The program can be modified to generate lottery combinations based on different input values. The logic for generating the combinations is contained in the numbers() method. You can modify this method to generate combinations based on different input values or to change the number of integers generated for each combination.
